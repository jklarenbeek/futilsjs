# # futilsjs

A collection of javascript helper functions for fast vector math and more, lots more! This and all my other projects are under heavy development, so please use or try with caution.

This library is created as a personal merge of some usefull javascript functions, modules and classes that I programmed or used over the years. There are also code snippits that I picked up from forums like stackoverflow and the like. Anyway, stuff that I used, or wanted to use, and some refactored from plain C or other languages. For this reason and because I'm in the middle of this process, don't expect to much.

To make my life even more fun, I forked the hyperapp version 1 sourcecode from github, refactored it and added some usefull stuff to it like vnode attribute flattening. I'm not any garanty at the moment that futilsjs works; but it do only check in when it compiles.

Another interesting collection of function and classes is the JSONSchema validator. In this context I added it to futilsjs in order to separate logic from aformjs, which is under heavy development too :).

Keep in mind that for the time being this repo will change a lot, really fast. So if you want to use it, I suggest you copy the dist file to your project and include it that way.

It is recommended to clone this repository first and then npm-link it into your own project. I do this, to fix bugs in futilsjs when they pop-up (immediatly) or add more functionality (when I get to it). There is more coming in the following months, so follow us. You don't have to clone the repo, because there is a npm package available as well. Follow the steps described below, to get futilsjs up and running.

## ## npm install futilsjs

Note: this is not the preferred method! npm futilsjs is out of date and i still want to change versioning back to v0.0.1; that would be the more realistic view of the version I am at.

But as the name suggests, it should be not more difficult then this. Go to your favorite local project that your working on and type:

```sh
$~/myprojectjs> npm install --save futilsjs
```

This will do all the magick for you. Now you can use futilsjs by simply refering to it from your sourcecode like so:

```js
import { isPureObject } from 'futilsjs';
const a = isPureObject([]);
console.log('an array is not a pure object ', a !== true);
```

Tadaaa! Have fun using futilsjs! (BUT AGAIN, DON'T USE IT THIS WAY!)

## ## git clone and install futilsjs

In order to make futilsjs available to your projects we use npm-link. First clone the repository. You can use any target name as the last parameter of the git clone command. For this demonstration we use the futilsjs/ directory name and we enter it.

```sh
$~/> git clone https://github.com/jklarenbeek/futilsjs.git futilsjs
$~/> cd futilsjs
$~/futilsjs>
```

Then install all the necessary development dependencies. The following command will install all devDependencies from the package.json file for you automatically.

```sh
$~/futilsjs> npm install
```

Now its time to build it. Rollup will do an excellent job, just for that purpose. Let's run rollup by running the build script from the command line like so:

```sh
$~/futilsjs> npm run build
created ./dist/index.js in 8.8s
```

The resulting futilsjs distribution file is generated by rollup and copied into the dist/ directory. Lets go there and make futilsjs available to our other projects.

```sh
$~/futilsjs> cd ./dist/
$~/futilsjs/dist> npm link
```

Thats it! Just wauw :) futilsjs is now available for linking into your own projects.

In order to use it, you need to go to your project and use npm-link again. But this time, call futilsjs by its name.

```sh
$~/futilsjs/dist> cd ~/myprojectjs/
$~/myprojectjs> npm link futilsjs
```

Take note that we use the futilsjs name in the npm link command and not any other name that you cloned it to. From here its the same as using npm install futilsjs.
