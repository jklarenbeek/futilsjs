# futilsjs

A collection of javascript helper functions for fast vector math and more, lots more!

This library is created as a personal merge of some usefull javascript functions, modules and classes that I programmed or used over the years. There are also code snippits that I picked up from forums like stackoverflow and the like. Anyway, stuff that I used, or wanted to use, and some refactored from C or other languages just for that.

To make my life even more fun, I forked the hyperapp version 1 sourcecode from github, refactored it and added some usefull stuff to it like css classname array handling. Therefor projects made with futilsjs are not backwards compatible with hyperapp. Don't worry, hyperapp version 2 is very different from its version 1 counterpart. For this reason I fork stuff and change it as I see fit. But not to break other public repositories that use futils; [like aformjs](https://github.com/jklarenbeek/aformjs).

It is recommended to clone this repository first and then npm-link it into your own project. I do this, to fix bugs in futilsjs when they pop-up (immediatly) or add more functionality (when I get to it). There is more coming in the following months, so follow us. You don't have to clone the repo, because there is a npm package available as well. Follow the steps described below, to get futilsjs up and running.

## ## npm install futilsjs

As the name suggests, it not more difficult then this. Go to your favorite local project that your working on and type:

```sh
$~/myprojectjs> npm install --save futilsjs
```

This will do all the magick for you. Now you can use futilsjs by simply refering to it from your sourcecode like so:

```js
import { isPureObject } from 'futils';
const a = isPureObject([]);
console.log('an array is not a pure object ', a !== true);
```

Tadaaa! Have fun using futilsjs!

## ## git clone and install futilsjs

In order to make futilsjs available to your projects we use npm-link. First clone the repository. You can use any target name as the last parameter of the git clone command. For this demonstration we use the futilsjs/ directory name and we enter it.

```sh
$~/> git clone https://github.com/jklarenbeek/futilsjs.git futilsjs
$~/> cd futilsjs
$~/futilsjs>
```

Then install all the necessary development dependencies. The following command will install all devDependencies from the package.json file for you automatically.

```sh
$~/futilsjs> npm install
```

Now its time to build it. Rollup will do an excellent job, just for that purpose. Let's run rollup by running the build script from the command line like so:

```sh
$~/futilsjs> npm run build
created ./dist/index.js in 8.8s
```

The resulting futilsjs distribution file is generated by rollup and copied into the dist/ directory. Lets go there and make futilsjs available to our other projects.

```sh
$~/futilsjs> cd ./dist/
$~/futilsjs/dist> npm link
```

Thats it! Just wauw :) futilsjs is now available for linking into your own projects.

In order to use it, you need to go to your project and use npm-link again. But this time, call futilsjs by its name.

```sh
$~/futilsjs/dist> cd ~/myprojectjs/
$~/myprojectjs> npm link futilsjs
```

Take note that we use the futilsjs name in the npm link command. This name is defined in the package.json file from the futilsjs repository and has no relation to the location of the cloned futilsjs directory created at the beginning.

From here its the same as using npm install futilsjs.
